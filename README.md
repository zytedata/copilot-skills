> Not using exclusively GitHub Copilot CLI? See [Zyte Coding Agent Add-Ons](https://docs.zyte.com/ai-code.html) for alternatives.

## Install

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add zytedata/copilot-skills
copilot plugin install zyte-web-data@zyte-ai
```

If GitHub Copilot CLI is already running, restart the active session to load the plugin.

---

## What it does

This is Zyte's official [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) plugin that generates production-ready [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org) spiders with [web-poet](https://web-poet.readthedocs.io) page objects from a plain-English prompt. Give it a URL and describe what you want to extract. It handles site exploration, schema discovery, code generation, and smoke testing: no boilerplate, no manual selector hunting.

The plugin explores the target site, discovers available fields, and presents a schema for your approval before generating a single line of code. After you confirm the schema, it creates a Scrapy project with all dependencies configured, generates web-poet page objects and test fixtures, wires up the spider, and runs a smoke test to verify that extraction is working before handing the project back to you.

Optionally, use `/zyte` to deploy directly to [Scrapy Cloud](https://www.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/) for scheduled runs, job history, and monitoring. A [free tier is available](https://docs.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/pricing.md).

---

## Use cases

The `/scrape` skill works on any website with repeating structured content: detail pages linked from a listing or category page. Examples from the skill:

- Product catalogs
- Job listings
- Recipes

---

## How does it work?

The `/scrape` skill orchestrates two stages automatically:

```
1. Plan and validate the scrape     →  /scrape-plan
2. Build the project and spider     →  /scrapy-extra
```

Each stage feeds directly into the next. When the pipeline completes, you have a runnable spider and a passing test suite:

```bash
uv run scrapy crawl <spider_name>
uv run pytest fixtures/
```

## Skills

### Orchestration

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `scrape` | End-to-end web scraping workflow — from URL to working spider with web-poet page objects |

### Pipeline stages (called automatically by `/scrape`)

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `scrape-plan` | Plan the scrape and author a validated extraction spec: discover fields, download diverse pages, compare HTML variants, optional browser review |
| `scrape-analyze-page` | Extract all available fields with values from a detail page |
| `scrapy-extra` | Hands-on Scrapy coding: write/debug spiders, web-poet page objects, and projects; configure scrapy-poet and scrapy-zyte-api |

### Zyte APIs

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `zyte` | Interact with Zyte's APIs and cloud services: set up your Zyte account and credentials; deploy projects, schedule spiders, list/stop jobs, and view items or logs on [Scrapy Cloud](https://www.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/); query historical [Zyte API](https://www.zyte.com/zyte-api/) usage stats; look up Zyte API pricing and per-website costs; and answer how-to and documentation questions about Zyte from the official docs |

---

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli)
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — used to create and manage the Scrapy project

Project dependencies (scrapy, scrapy-poet, scrapy-zyte-api, web-poet, extruct, price-parser, pytest) are installed automatically by the skills.

---

## Quickstart

Any scraping prompt triggers the skill automatically. For example:

```
Scrape books.toscrape.com
```

The plugin walks you through schema approval interactively, then generates a complete, tested Scrapy project.

---

## Update

To update manually, update the marketplace and plugin:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add zytedata/copilot-skills
copilot plugin update zyte-web-data
```

Then restart the GitHub Copilot CLI session.

---

## Evaluation

We automatically evaluate skills and track both wall time and cost. We measure and aim to improve these metrics over time.

---

## Feedback

If you find any issue — such as prompts that did not work as expected, or that caused excessive wall time or cost — please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/zytedata/copilot-skills/issues).

Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce the issue. You are welcome to anonymize target websites or other data.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is a Zyte account required?

No. The generated spider is a standard Scrapy project that runs locally with `uv`. A Zyte account is required only if you want to deploy to [Scrapy Cloud](https://www.zyte.com/scrapy-cloud/) or use [Zyte API](https://www.zyte.com/zyte-api/) to access sites that block standard scrapers. If you want to use Zyte API, you'll need an account to generate an API key.

### Does it handle JavaScript-rendered pages?

The generated project includes `scrapy-zyte-api` as a dependency. Enabling headless browser rendering requires a [Zyte API](https://www.zyte.com/zyte-api/) key. The `/zyte` skill guides you through setting up your credentials.

### What Python libraries does the generated project use?

The project template includes `scrapy`, `scrapy-poet`, `scrapy-zyte-api`, `web-poet`, `extruct`, `price-parser`, and `pytest`. All dependencies are installed automatically via `uv sync`.

### Can the generated spider run without GitHub Copilot CLI?

Yes. The plugin generates a standard Scrapy project. Run it directly with:

```bash
uv run scrapy crawl <spider_name>
```

You can extend, modify, and deploy it independently of GitHub Copilot CLI.
